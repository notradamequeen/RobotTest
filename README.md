# RobotTest
This is a simulator of a “toy robot”. You will be writing code to place and move the
“robot” within a grid on a tabletop with ReactJS

The robot will be placed and move on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 units x 5
units (Or definable by user). There are no other obstructions on the table surface.
